This is a jpg2pdf converter I wrote in Java using Maven libraries:

iText 7

Maven assmbly, shade, comipler, and jar plugins

Uses all of iText 7s libraries so I can save space later by trimming to my needs.

ToDo:

GUI

Multiple format functionality

PDF Merge

Write temp files to RAM instead of drive

some other stuff whatever I think of.
